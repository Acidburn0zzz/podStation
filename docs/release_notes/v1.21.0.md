## New features

### MediaSession support for metadata and controls

This is an implementation for feature [#38](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/38) (github)

Have you seen the new cool feature on Google Chrome where you can see and control all media from a button on the toolbar (global media controls).  
This feature was recently introduced on the desktop versions of the browser and I could not wait to support it!
