# podStation Chrome Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/podStation/podStation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/podStation/podStation)

## About 

**podStation** is a podcast aggregator for chrome.

You can install the extension at the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/podstation/bpcagekijmfcocgjlnnhpdogbplajjfn).

### Vision

podStation has reached a mature state where increments are more tipically on the direction of bug fixes and optimizatinons.

If you would like to see all the proposed enhancements, check the open issues in the project (link will be added later for both github and bitbucket issues).

Some features I consider more important (I will add links to existing issues later):
- Become **podStation Browser Extension**: podStation is currently only available for chrome. Althouth this most likely address the majority of possible users, I don't like the idea of contributing to _vendor lock-in_. Having a port that works on other browsers would make it easier for our users to choose other browsers, and contribute to the competitiveness of this market
- Reduce the necessary _permissions_ required by podStation

There are also some features that I would like to implement, but they are unlikely to become a reality, as it would be a lot of effort:
- Support _marking episodes as listened_ (history) - not enough Snyc Storage space
- Integration with [mygpo](https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo) (http://gpodder.net/)

## Development

### Installing the dependencies

You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After that, install the dependencies in the following order:
* `npm install`
* `npm run bower-install`
* `./copy_dependencies.sh`

2. Go to chrome's extensions page [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable the _Developer Mode_
4. Click the button _Load unpacked extension_.
5. Choose the `extension` folder

Voil√†!  
You should see podStation's icon on chrome's toolbar.  
You are now running a local copy of podStation, have fun!

### Automated tests
